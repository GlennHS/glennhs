### `Hello World!`, and welcome to the coolest place on the internet ðŸ˜Ž

Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Glenn!</span> I make [websites](https://glennhs.co.uk) and [applications](https://github.com/GlennHS/AEtherSlay), mostly using **JavaScript, NodeJS, C# and Python!** I'm a curious programmer with a love of learning and a passion for improving. I'm always seeking out new challenges and love the sense of accomplishment from figuring out the solution to something tricky ðŸ’ª

I'm currently certified in both **Marketo and Pardot**, having achieved my certifications in both of them within 8 months of starting my role at [Clevertouch Marketing](https://clever-touch.com)! I specialise in web development and am continuously looking to improve my skills!

I have started learning **Vue and Vite** and am thoroughly enjoying them. I have also dabbled in **Laravel** and aim to get back into that now that I'm far more competent with Vue. I have also been learning some **Unity C#** as I hope to properly enter the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) contest this coming September/October!

&nbsp;

I'm currently working on a fun little app called [Center](https://github.com/GlennHS/Vue-Center). It's a small to do list app in **Vue** that I'm making in order to supplement my learning. It's been a fantastic way of learning Vue and **Vite**, plus its really helped reignite my passion for development!

At the moment it's very basic and not being hosted anywhere but the repo is public and it's really simple to clone down and take a look! I've mostly been pushing myself to see what cool CSS tricks I can do and see how pretty I can make the components, especially the checkbox and the priority pillbox! I'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do, and all the learning that's to come ðŸ˜„
